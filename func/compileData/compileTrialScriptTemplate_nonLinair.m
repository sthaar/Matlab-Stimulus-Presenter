%% Speed experiment findings
% A if argument will slow down by >0.001 ms
% using strcmpi instead of integers or floats is NOT slower:
% 1.6703e-05 for 8 compare if's with t==5
% 1.6895e-05 for 8 compare if's with strcmp
% Timing is the same for both (the sd will be something like 0.01e-05)
% Considering this, starting a timer in a loop and in the next iteration
% give a stimuli and the Next iteration get the timer will only add 1ms of
% computation (given that the simuli is loaded in the loop on a SSD)
% This might not be the best, therefore a timing solution loop will be
% made.

%% The kind of loops that are,  will be or should be implementented.
% First off, the the 0 mode called default mode.
% Everything works as expected but there are significant delays in timings.
% This mode can be used when the stimuli are movies (30sec+), when the interval
% between stimuli and timing of the reaction is of no importance.
% Do not use when you want things like (image - 2ms - image) or (image -
% 0ms - sound). It just wont do.
